## Program modules
* Stats functions        
* Rng functions
* Sampling functions
* Calculator functions (from previous homework)

## Recommended Plan of Attack
We need to divide the tasks among the team members in a way that will minimize how much we trip over each other
* Minimize potential for merge conflicts
* One branch per 'module' or one branch per team member
* Dependencies need to be scaffolded first
* Treat dev like you would treat master

## Branching Strategy
* Recommend all branches come off dev and return to dev, master stays pristine
* When starting for the day, pull from the other branches if they have something you depend on
* When ending for the day, push your branch

## Pull Requests (PR) tentative schedule
* The pull request is a fancy `git pull` with comments attached
* Minor PRs from each module to dev, 3-4 days from completion
* One big final PR from dev to master, last day
* Prof. would probably like to see a small discussion in the comments, at least for dev->master
